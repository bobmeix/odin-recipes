    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Step 1</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>
            In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed<br>
            tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1<br>
            teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br>
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Step 2</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain<br>
            noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2<br>
            teaspoon salt.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Step 3</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Step 4</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over<br>
            meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1<br>
            1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining<br>
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure<br>
            the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Step 5</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>
            Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before<br>
            serving.
